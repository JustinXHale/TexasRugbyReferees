## Mission
The Texas Rugby Referee Association (TRRA) recruits, trains, coaches, assigns, and supports
match officials across Texas. We develop referees at every level, promote safety and game
management grounded in World Rugby Laws, and help raise the standard of rugby in our region.

## What We Do
- **Education & Certification** — Support USA Rugby pathways for accreditation and compliance.
- **Appointments** — Assign referees and ARs for league, collegiate, club, and tournaments statewide.
- **Coaching & Feedback** — On-field coaching, evaluations, and development plans.
- **Community** — Supportive culture for officials; collaboration with competitions and clubs.

## Governance & Partnerships
- **Bylaws** — Define membership, elections, and operations (approved 2014).
- **Texas Rugby Union (TRU)** — TRRA works alongside TRU, which oversees adult rugby in the region.
- **USA Rugby** — Accreditation, SafeSport, background checks, and Law guidance align with USA Rugby.
