Ross Davies grew up in Newport, Wales, where rugby is woven into everyday life. He picked up the sport at the age of eight, and his early passion carried him all the way to the professional ranks. Over a 15-year playing career, Davies represented clubs across several countries and wore the Welsh jersey up to under-21 level, including a Junior World Cup appearance. Those years instilled both resilience and perspective, shaping a rugby journey marked by both triumphs and challenges.<br><br>

In 2020, after retiring from professional play, Davies turned to refereeing. Motivated by a belief that the game deserved higher standards of officiating, he embraced the role as a way to give back to the sport he loved. Since then, he has refereed numerous high-level men’s and women’s matches, including state finals in Texas and fixtures beyond state borders. His style reflects his personality: a straight shooter with a dry sense of humor, unafraid of tough calls and dedicated to fairness.<br><br>

Alongside his work on the field, Davies has taken on significant leadership roles in the rugby community. As chairman of the Texas Rugby Referee Association (TRRA), he has worked to develop referees across the region, while also serving as a coach at the national level. His experience as a professional player gives him a unique perspective in mentoring others, bridging the worlds of playing and officiating.<br><br>

Through every chapter of his rugby life—whether as a player, referee, coach, or leader—Davies has remained defined by his passion and fire for the game. His journey reflects a commitment not only to personal excellence but also to raising the standard of rugby for the wider community.  </p>

Christopher Pugh began playing rugby in the Spring of 2013 at the University of Texas at San Antonio, when he saw a recruiting table in front of the UTSA Sombrilla. They were holding practice that afternoon, he decided to give the sport a try & he never looked back. He played at UTSA for 4 years before graduating in 2016 and transitioning to the senior men’s level and played two seasons with Alamo City Rugby Football Club.<br><br>

Before his final season as a player, Christopher took his L1 course in July 2017 because he knew the writing was on the wall as injuries started piling up but he wasn’t ready to give up this that he loved. Christopher Pugh quickly left his mark across the state, refereeing numerous matches from McAllen to Dallas, and everywhere in between. In 2023, he was selected to the Regional Development Group by USA Rugby. In 2024 he was asked to join the board as the Secretary, to give his opinion on matters as well as take notes for the board during meetings & later took on the role as social media manager.  </p>

Jonathan “Jono” Cooper has been immersed in rugby from an early age, shaped by his South African parents and their traditions, including watching the Natal Sharks and Springboks. Growing up in Colorado, he translated that passion into playing rugby through high school and later at Baylor University, where he led the Men’s Rugby Team as President of the Club from 2017 to 2019. Even after an injury curtailed his collegiate playing career, Jono refused to step away from the game, instead taking up the whistle in 2016 with the Texas Rugby Referee Association (TRRA) to stay involved and support the sport’s growth.<br><br>

Since then, Jono has become a fixture in American rugby refereeing. He is affiliated with TRRA, the Rocky Mountain Rugby Referees, and the USA Rugby Referees National Development Group, while also serving as an Assistant Referee for Major League Rugby. His leadership extends beyond the pitch: he currently serves as Regional Representative for TRRA’s South Region and is active internationally as a Citing Commissioner with USA Rugby, Rugby Americas North, and World Rugby.<br><br>

On the field, Jono’s career includes assistant refereeing 17 Major League Rugby matches and center refereeing high-profile fixtures such as Army vs. Air Force in Glendale, Colorado, in 2023 and the Gulf Region Super Regionals in 2024 and 2025. Off the field, he has brought his expertise to some of the sport’s biggest stages as Citing Commissioner at the LA SVNS 2024 and the Junior Pan American Games in Paraguay in 2025.<br><br>

Driven by a belief that “rugby is one of the best sports in the world and everyone deserves the best match possible,” Jono approaches every assignment—from youth matches to international competitions—with the same commitment to fairness and excellence. He continues to be a passionate advocate for rugby’s growth in the United States, combining his professional discipline as an attorney with his dedication to supporting referees, players, and the wider rugby community.  </p>

Justin X. Hale began his rugby journey in 2008 as a high school player in Dallas, Texas, where he quickly developed a lifelong passion for the sport.
